## The Blunder

Samantha was tasked with calculating the average monthly salaries for all employees in the EMPLOYEES table, but did not realize her keyboard's 0 
key was broken until after completing the calculation. She wants your help finding the difference between her miscalculation (using salaries with
any zeros removed), and the actual average salary.

Write a query calculating the amount of error (i.e.: actual - miscalculated average monthly salaries), and round it up to the next integer.

Input Format

The EMPLOYEES table is described as follows:

| Column | Type |
| --- | --- |
| ID | Integer |
| Name | String |
| Salary | Integer |

Note: Salary is per month.

select
    round(avg(salary))- round(avg(replace(salary, 0, '')))
from employees;

## Top Earners

We define an employee's total earnings to be their monthly salary x months worked, and the maximum total earnings to be the maximum total earnings for any
employee in the Employee table. Write a query to find the maximum total earnings for all employees as well as the total number of employees 
who have maximum total earnings. Then print these values as 2 space-separated integers.

The Employee table containing employee data for a company is described as follows:

| Column | Type |

Where employee_id is an employee's ID number, name is their name, months is the total number of months they've been working for the company,
and salary is the their monthly salary.
